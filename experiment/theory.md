<strong> Theory :  </strong><br> Bode computes the magnitude and phase of the frequency response of LTI models. When
invoked without left-side arguments, bode produces a Bode plot on the screen. <br>The magnitude is
plotted in decibels (dB), and the phase in degrees. <br>The decibel calculation for magnitude is
computed as 20log10 (|H(jw)|), where H(jw) is the system's frequency response. <br>Bode plots are
used to analyze system properties such as the gain margin, phase margin, DC gain, bandwidth,
disturbance rejection, and stability.
